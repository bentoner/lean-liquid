# locally_constant

The files in this directory set up the theory of locally constant maps
from profinite spaces to normed groups (such a space inherits
a normed group structure via the sup norm). It also sets up the theory
of completions of normed groups, and hence the definition "M-hat"
in definition 8.18 of `analytic.pdf` .
