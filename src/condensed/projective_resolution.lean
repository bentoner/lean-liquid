S extr. disc.
A cond ab group.

A â†¦ Hom_{CondSet}(S,A) = A(S) commutes with limits and colimits.

A(-) commutes with finite products, in Ab, finite products = finite coproducts.

Z[S] is projective.

A -> B epi, Hom(Z[S],A) -> Hom(Z[S],B) -- A(S) -> B(S) WTS: surjective.

1. If S is extr. disc. and A -> B is an epi of cond ab, then A(S) -> B(S) surjective.
  B -> B/A
